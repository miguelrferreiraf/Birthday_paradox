# Birthday paradox
## Birthday paradox is a probabilistic phenomenon that happens when we notice that is not necessary a lot of people sharing 
## the same environment to some of them to have the same birthday. Indeed, the number of people may be less than you think
## for this to happen!

### If 23 people share the same environment, that's already 50% of chance some of them share the same birthday. If it's 70
### people, chances jumps to 99,9%.

### This code contains simulation that combines Monte Carlo experiments that tests each probability according to a number chosed
### by the user, running 50.000 simulations for each scenario.
